# GitHub Actions Workflows Documentation

This repository contains a comprehensive set of reusable GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, and publishing various types of applications and libraries.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To use these workflows in your project, create a workflow file in your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    uses: tehw0lf/workflows/.github/workflows/build-test-publish.yml@main
    permissions:
      actions: write        # Required for workflow management
      contents: write       # Required for GitHub releases
      packages: write       # Required for Docker/GHCR publishing
      security-events: write # Required for security scanning (SARIF uploads)
      id-token: write       # REQUIRED - Always needed (currently for npm Trusted Publishing, planned for future OIDC integrations)
    with:
      tool: npm
      lint: "run lint"
      test: "run test"
      build_main: "run build"
      artifact_path: "dist"
      event_name: ${{ github.event_name }}
      docker_meta: '[{"name":"my-app","file":"Dockerfile"}]'
      libraries: "lib1,lib2"
      library_path: "packages"
    secrets: inherit
```

**Important permissions:**
- **`id-token: write` is REQUIRED for all workflows** - Currently used for npm, Python, and Rust Trusted Publishing (no NPM_TOKEN, UV_TOKEN, or CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN needed!), with plans to extend OIDC to other publishing workflows in the future
- **`security-events: write` is REQUIRED** - Enables SARIF uploads to GitHub Security tab for centralized vulnerability tracking
- Due to GitHub Actions limitations, these permissions must be set at the top-level calling workflow, regardless of which publishing workflows you use
- If using `release-it` for npm, add `.release-it.json` with `{"npm": {"skipChecks": true}}`

```

**Defense-in-depth architecture:**
1. **Pre-build** (security-scan-source.yml): Scan code & dependencies → Prevent vulnerable builds
2. **Build** (test-and-build.yml): Create artifacts
3. **Post-build** (security-scan-artifacts.yml): Scan artifacts → Block vulnerable publishes
4. **Publish**: Only if both security layers pass ✅

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Required Secrets & Permissions

#### Required Permissions (ALL WORKFLOWS)

**IMPORTANT:** The `id-token: write` permission is **REQUIRED for all workflows**, regardless of which publishing targets you use:

```yaml
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    uses: tehw0lf/workflows/.github/workflows/build-test-publish.yml@main
    permissions:
      id-token: write       # REQUIRED - Always needed for OIDC (npm/Python Trusted Publishing + future integrations)
      actions: write        # Required for workflow management
      contents: write       # Required for GitHub releases
      packages: write       # Required for Docker/GHCR publishing
      security-events: write # REQUIRED - For security scanning SARIF uploads
    with:
      tool: npm
      # ... other inputs
```

**Why are these permissions always required?**

**`id-token: write`:**
- Currently used for npm, Python, and Rust Trusted Publishing (no NPM_TOKEN, UV_TOKEN, or CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN needed!)
- Planned for future OIDC integrations with other publishing targets (Docker registries, etc.)
- Due to GitHub Actions limitations, permissions cannot be conditionally granted in reusable workflows
- Must be set at the top-level calling workflow, even if you're not publishing to npm, PyPI, or crates.io

**`security-events: write`:**
- Required for uploading SARIF reports to GitHub Security tab
- Enables centralized security vulnerability tracking across repositories
- Provides detailed security findings for Semgrep, Bandit, Trivy, and Grype scans
- Cannot be conditionally granted in reusable workflows

#### Required Secrets

Add these secrets to your repository settings based on your publishing targets:

```yaml
# For Docker publishing
GITHUB_TOKEN: # Auto-provided by GitHub

# For npm publishing - NO NPM_TOKEN NEEDED!
# Uses Trusted Publishing (Provenance) with OIDC
# Requires: id-token: write permission (see above)

# For Python publishing - NO UV_TOKEN NEEDED!
# Uses Trusted Publishing (Provenance) with OIDC
# Requires: id-token: write permission (see above)

# For Rust/Cargo publishing - NO CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN NEEDED!
# Uses OIDC Trusted Publishing (RFC 3691)
# Requires: id-token: write permission (see above)

# For Firefox extensions
AMO_API_KEY: # Mozilla Add-ons API key
AMO_API_SECRET: # Mozilla Add-ons API secret

# For Android builds
ANDROID_STOREPASS: # Android keystore password

# For Nx Cloud (optional)
NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN: # Nx Cloud access token
```

### 2. Release-it Configuration for npm Publishing

When using `release-it` with Trusted Publishing, you need to configure it to skip npm's built-in checks since the workflow handles authentication via OIDC.

Create a `.release-it.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "npm": {
    "skipChecks": true
  }
}
```

**Why is this needed?**
- Release-it normally checks for npm authentication before publishing
- With Trusted Publishing, authentication happens automatically via GitHub's OIDC token
- `skipChecks: true` tells release-it to trust the workflow's authentication

### 3. Project Structure Examples

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Dual-Layer Security Scanning (Defense-in-Depth)

**100% free and open-source security tools** - no signup, no limits, industry-standard:

#### Layer 1: Pre-Build Source Scanning
Prevents vulnerable code from being built:
- ✅ **Semgrep SAST**: Fast static analysis for all languages
  - Configurable rulesets: auto, p/security-audit, p/owasp-top-ten, p/ci
  - Detects: SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure patterns
- ✅ **Bandit** (Python): Source code security analysis for Python projects
- ✅ **pip-audit** (Python): Official PyPA tool for dependency vulnerability scanning
- ✅ **npm/yarn audit** (Node.js): Built-in dependency vulnerability scanning

#### Layer 2: Post-Build Artifact Scanning
Final security gate before publishing:
- ✅ **Trivy**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanner
  - Scans: Docker images, filesystem artifacts, packages, configs
  - Configurable severity thresholds (UNKNOWN, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- ✅ **Grype**: Redundant vulnerability scanner for additional coverage
- ✅ **Security summary tables**: Visual reports in workflow output
- ✅ **SARIF uploads**: Centralized findings in GitHub Security tab

#### Configuration
```yaml
with:
  enable_security_scanning: "true"           # Enable/disable (default: enabled)
  semgrep_rules: "auto"                      # Semgrep ruleset
  trivy_severity: "MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL"     # Severity threshold
  trivy_exit_code: "1"                        # 0=warn only, 1=fail build
```

#### Execution Flow
```
lint → security_scan_source → test_and_build → security_scan_artifacts → [publishing jobs]
  ✅         ✅                      ✅                   ✅                      ✅
```

All jobs depend on successful security scans - **vulnerable code cannot be published**.

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Simple Node.js App (with npm Publishing)
```yaml
name: build and publish pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    name: external workflow
    uses: tehw0lf/workflows/.github/workflows/build-test-publish.yml@main
    permissions:
      id-token: write       # REQUIRED - Always needed (npm Trusted Publishing + future OIDC)
      actions: write        # Required for workflow management
      contents: write       # Required for GitHub releases
      packages: write       # Required for Docker/GHCR publishing
      security-events: write # Required for security scanning (SARIF uploads)
    with:
      tool: npm
      lint: "run lint"
      test: "run test"
      build_main: "run build"
      artifact_path: "dist"
      library_path: "dist"
      event_name: ${{ github.event_name }}
```

**Note:** This example follows the pattern from `/Coding/AI/n8n/nodes/toon` which uses Trusted Publishing for npm.

### Docker + npm Publishing
```yaml
uses: tehw0lf/workflows/.github/workflows/build-test-publish.yml@main
permissions:
  id-token: write       # REQUIRED - Always needed (npm Trusted Publishing + future OIDC)
  contents: read
  packages: write       # Required for Docker publishing to GHCR
  security-events: write # Required for security scanning (SARIF uploads)
with:
  tool: npm
  build_main: "run build"
  artifact_path: "dist"
  docker_meta: '[{"name":"my-app","file":"Dockerfile"}]'
  docker_namespace: "mycompany"
  registry: "ghcr.io"
  event_name: ${{ github.event_name }}
```

### Python Package
```yaml
uses: tehw0lf/workflows/.github/workflows/build-test-publish.yml@main
permissions:
  id-token: write       # REQUIRED - Always needed (Python Trusted Publishing)
  contents: read
  security-events: write # Required for security scanning (SARIF uploads)
with:
  tool: uv
  install: "sync"
  lint: "run lint"
  test: "run test"
  build_main: "build"
  artifact_path: "dist"
  event_name: ${{ github.event_name }}
```

### Rust Crate
```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build_and_publish:
    uses: tehw0lf/workflows/.github/workflows/build-test-publish.yml@main
    permissions:
      id-token: write       # REQUIRED - For OIDC Trusted Publishing to crates.io
      actions: write
      contents: write
      packages: write
      security-events: write
    with:
      tool: cargo
      artifact_path: target/release/my-crate
      event_name: ${{ github.event_name }}

      # Rust configuration (all optional - defaults shown)
      rust_version: stable
      enable_rustfmt: true
      enable_clippy: true
      clippy_args: "-- -D warnings"

      # Security scanning
      enable_security_scanning: "true"

      # GitHub release configuration (optional)
      publish_github_release: ${{ startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v') && 'true' || 'false' }}
      release_tag: ${{ github.ref_name }}
```

**Note:** Before first publish, configure Trusted Publisher on crates.io for your repository. No secrets required!

### Bash Scripts
```yaml
uses: tehw0lf/workflows/.github/workflows/build-test-publish.yml@main
permissions:
  id-token: write       # REQUIRED - Always needed
  contents: read
  security-events: write # Required for security scanning (SARIF uploads)
with:
  tool: bash
  install: "install.sh"
  lint: "lint.sh"
  test: "test.sh"
  build_main: "build.sh"
  artifact_path: "dist"
  event_name: ${{ github.event_name }}
```

**Execution order:**
1. **lint** - Validate all workflows with actionlint
2. **security-scan-source** - Pre-build security scanning (Semgrep, Bandit, pip-audit, npm audit)
3. **test-and-build** - Run tests and build artifacts
4. **security-scan-artifacts** - Post-build security scanning (Trivy, Grype)
5. **[publishing jobs]** - Only execute if all security scans pass
6. **summarize-workflow** - Aggregate results and report status

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build timeouts**: Adjust timeout values in workflow files
2. **Cache misses**: Check cache key patterns and dependencies
3. **Permission errors**: Verify repository secrets and permissions
4. **Artifact not found**: Ensure `artifact_path` is correctly set

### npm Trusted Publishing Issues

#### Error: "npm ERR! need auth This command requires you to be logged in"
**Solution:** Ensure `id-token: write` permission is set in your workflow:
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
```

#### Error: "release-it: npm authentication check failed"
**Solution:** Add `.release-it.json` to skip npm checks when using Trusted Publishing:
```json
{
  "npm": {
    "skipChecks": true
  }
}
```

#### Error: "Unable to get OIDC token"
**Solution:**
- Verify `id-token: write` permission is granted
- Ensure your npm package is configured for [Trusted Publishing on npmjs.com](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements)
- Check that your GitHub repository has access to npm's OIDC provider

### Security Scanning Issues

#### Error: "failed to upload SARIF"
**Solution:** Ensure `security-events: write` permission is granted:
```yaml
permissions:
  security-events: write
```

#### Error: "Semgrep scan failed"
**Solution:**
- Check the security tab for specific findings
- Review Semgrep rules configuration (`semgrep_rules` input)
- For false positives, add `# nosemgrep` comments or adjust ruleset
- Disable security scanning temporarily with `enable_security_scanning: "false"` (not recommended)

#### Error: "Trivy found HIGH vulnerabilities"
**Solution:**
- Review vulnerabilities in the security tab or workflow output
- Update dependencies to patched versions
- Adjust severity threshold if needed: `trivy_severity: "CRITICAL"` (less strict)
- Set `trivy_exit_code: "0"` to warn only (not recommended for production)

#### Disable Security Scanning (Not Recommended)
If you need to temporarily disable security scanning:
```yaml
with:
  enable_security_scanning: "false"
```

**Warning:** Disabling security scanning removes critical protection against vulnerabilities. Only use this for testing or non-production workflows.
